Experience-sharing-and-life-automation
======================================

I liked the idea of opensource religion but in sense experience sharing and life automation. because part of success depends on expirience to be able to choose wisely

After studying jewish talmud for some time I undersood that the idea of any religion is to automate life in a useful way of using good defaults and good preperations with intention to generate positive outcomes.

I have studied success for several years
And  I see the use of belif very in a useful way. People dont know much about belif and hope. it is a good idea to develop this knowlage.
Belif is helps skip places in life you don't you dont have an updated state for some period of time.

Hope is what shapes your dreams and directs you in life it is good idea to learn about yourself in this area that others shape you with that power over you because you dont understan yourself well and have hard time to notice hope kicked in.

Beliving stupidly is stupidity. People should understand why it is so and how it works and why it is useful. Everything in this book should come from understanding so people can make their own decisions wicely specific to their situation.
